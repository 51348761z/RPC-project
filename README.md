# RPC Framework

A simple Java RPC framework for learning distributed systems concepts.

## Overview

This project demonstrates core RPC concepts including service registration/discovery, network communication, and dynamic proxies.

## Features

- **Service Registration & Discovery**: ZooKeeper-based service management
- **Multiple Transport Protocols**: Netty and Socket implementations
- **Dynamic Proxy**: Transparent remote method calls

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Java 8+
- ZooKeeper
- Maven

### Running

1. Start ZooKeeper
2. Run server: `testServer`
3. Run client: `testClient`

## Learning Goals

- Understanding RPC communication patterns
- Service registration and discovery mechanisms
- Network protocol implementation
- Dynamic proxy usage in Java
